# LLM - Detect AI Generated Text

## Project Overview
This repository contains our team's submissions for the Kaggle competition titled "LLM - Detect AI Generated Text". The competition challenges participants to develop models that can distinguish between essays written by students and essays generated by various large language models (LLMs).

## Motivation
With the increasing capabilities of LLMs, distinguishing between human-generated and AI-generated text has become a critical task in ensuring the authenticity and integrity of academic works. This project aims to explore different machine learning approaches to address this challenge effectively.

## Models Used
We explored several machine learning models to classify the texts:
- **Random Forest** (scores : private : 0.710812  / public : 0.863999)
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** (scores : private : 0.600658 / public : 0.718528)
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** (scores : private : 0.697887 / public : 0.846263 )
- **Naive Bayes** (scores : private : 0.754808 / public : 0.848830)
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** (scores : private : 0.720903 / public : 0.827770)
- **Decision Trees** (scores : private : 0.577058 / public : 0.647503)
- **Logistic Regression** (scores : private : 0.729659 / public : 0.860210)

Each model is implemented in a separate Jupyter notebook within this repository.
